## What is Mirage?

Mirage is a project focused around bringing NFT's to the AR viewport and putting them in the hands of anyone with a phone. Utilizing [Apple's AR kit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), mirages can be placed by an artist and rendered in the real world, to then be navigated to and collected by users. This application is the companion web app for that IOS app and is where all Minting takes place for any piece collected by a user.
